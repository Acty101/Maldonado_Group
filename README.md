# Analyzing cyclic voltammograms using a neural network with TensorFlow 2 (Maldonado Lab)

*What is a cylic voltammogram? Here is an example below:*

A cyclic voltammogram is a graph of current against voltage and is obtained by measuring output current by varying voltage across an electrode. It is proned to many variations depending on the electrode used and the time it has been exposed to air. The goal of this project is to build and train a neural network that can correctly classify these variations. The results will be used for further analysis by the Maldonado Lab.

(Note: Accurate training data for the neural network and my previously trained model are not available. Data is generated using MATLAB code (not mine) and will soon have upwards of 10000 images.)
